#### ** BEGIN MESSAGE **

Welcome Citizen #00328, 

2 years ago our founder, Julian Harnon, began the dream of Arcadia.

2 days ago he was found dead.

The official verdict was suicide but the reality is that Arcadia and the change it signals is under systematic attack. First the company, now the founder. But the dream of justice for all, by all, will not die with him.

Today, I am opening up the records of Arcadia, Inc. Every past case, every file, every company record. With your help, the corrupted database can be restored and the case reports generated by Arcadia algorithm restored. If institutions will not seek truth, we will crowdsource it.

Justice is in your hands.

Yours truly,
A Concerned Citizen
